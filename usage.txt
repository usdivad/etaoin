#etaoin Usage Notes
#David Su 4/30/2013

#MACRO
- respective zipf distribution of "etaoin" within entire text <==> scale (pentatonic, dorian, whole tone, lydianb7, bebop, easterly) from which pitches are drawn

#BASS
- morse code of entire text (iterating through) <==> duration of each individual note == rhythm of overall bass pattern
- wavetype = pulse

#LINE
- weighted random selection of characters <==> rhythm (via morse code) and timbre (via consonants and vowels)
	- consonants (loosely grouped):
		nasal = n,m,r,l,w
		stop = p,b,k,g,d,t,c,q
		fricative = s,z,f,v,x,h,j
	... affect ADSR
	- vowels in loose formant shape order:
		o,u,a,e,i
	... affect wavetype (sin, tri, fami)

#PERC
- character typed in real-time <==> freq noise being probabilistically triggered on the same metronomic timer as the rest of the voices
- use of "trigger characters" (etaoin and vowels -> o,u,a,n,e,i,t) <==> alteration of freq used to generate noise

#MASK (for bass)
- punctuation typed in real-time <==> pad-like shine, sustained note based on bass
	- . = same freq as bass
	- ! = an octave above bass
	- ? = any freq in between (including microtones)
