e.g use individual letters to determine stuff like e.g. "all k's determine pitch ambitus", "all t's are perc sounds"

different combinations


how fast/slow you're inputting keys

INPUT

CLASSIFICATION
vowel/consonant, hard/soft sound
specific patterns

generate interesting behavior from "simple note from player"
- implementation is where the challenge is!

once you solve problem of classifying and assigning behavior, then input/output is modular, you can 

what is best architecture to do this?








timbre - wave type = vowels
plosive consonants = cons
deviation melodically from given scale = FK reading lvl
tempo = words per sentence
register? range?

every time you finish a sentence == scale change.

cons:
nasal = n,m,r,l,w
stop = p,b,k,g,d,t,c,q
fricative = s,z,f,v,x,h,j

vowels:
o,u,a,e,i,y
--> = more high
