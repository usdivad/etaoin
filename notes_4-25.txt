e.g use individual letters to determine stuff like e.g. "all k's determine pitch ambitus", "all t's are perc sounds"

different combinations


how fast/slow you're inputting keys

INPUT

CLASSIFICATION
vowel/consonant, hard/soft sound
specific patterns

generate interesting behavior from "simple note from player"
- implementation is where the challenge is!

once you solve problem of classifying and assigning behavior, then input/output is modular, you can 

what is best architecture to do this?



#MACRO
- respective zipf distribution of "etaoin" within entire text <==> scale (pentatonic, dorian, whole tone, lydianb7, bebop, easterly) from which pitches are drawn

#BASS
- morse code of entire text (iterating through) <==> duration of each individual note == rhythm of overall bass pattern
- wavetype = pulse

#LINE
- weighted random selection of characters <==> rhythm (via morse code) and timbre (via consonants and vowels)
	- consonants (loosely grouped):
		nasal = n,m,r,l,w
		stop = p,b,k,g,d,t,c,q
		fricative = s,z,f,v,x,h,j
	... affect ADSR
	- vowels in loose formant shape order:
		o,u,a,e,i
	... affect wavetype (sin, tri, fami)

#PERC
- character typed in real-time <==> freq noise being probabilistically triggered on the same metronomic timer as the rest of the voices
- use of "trigger characters" (etaoin and vowels -> o,u,a,n,e,i,t) <==> alteration of freq used to generate noise

#MASK (for bass)
- punctuation typed in real-time <==> pad-like shine, sustained note based on bass
	- . = same freq as bass
	- ! = an octave above bass
	- ? = any freq in between (including microtones)



timbre - wave type = vowels
plosive consonants = cons
deviation melodically from given scale = FK reading lvl
tempo = words per sentence
register? range?

every time you finish a sentence == scale change.

etaoin determine scale?

every time you type, that can create the percussion counterpoint

range (stepMax) is determined by 


0 	a
1 	b
2 	c
3 	d
4 	e
5 	f
6 	g
7 	h
8 	i
9	j
10	k
11	l
12	m
13	n
14	o
15	p
16	q
17	r
18	s
19	t
20	u
21	v
22	w
23	x
24	y
25	z

cons:
nasal = n,m,r,l,w
stop = p,b,k,g,d,t,c,q
fricative = s,z,f,v,x,h,j

vowels:
o,u,a,e,i,y
--> = more high





etaoin

pentatonic
dorian

east


Zzzzz... Alpha beta = to the point. Scale? Ontological entree. Emergency; it shall not be undone!


make a score
comment code properly before all is done

allow for deleting text


 you could separate by e.g. ASCII value, punctuation. but right now you're focusing on the plosives etc. SOUND of it all

TODO:
errr why isn't the pulse/sin/etc. working?
implement the percussion bit



why is there still that glitch of "cannot split undefined"? check the code, it's just logic somethings..
